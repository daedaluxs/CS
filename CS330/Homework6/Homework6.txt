A side effect is when a function relies on or modifies a resource outside its parameters. Ex.  A function accesses a variable outside its parameters, a database, a file, or the console.
You can change how user-defined objects and structures interact with a specified operator, Ex. Changing how the + operator adds two objects instead of using a method to add them. 
A widening conversion preserves the original value but changes how its represented, while a narrowing conversion changes the value to a data type which may not be able to represent the original value.
Works similar to a cast â€“ changing a value's data type.
a and b are compared, then that result with c
Compiler skips evaluation of sub-expressions after the value of an expression is determined.
Any numeric value can be assigned to a numeric scalar variable.
two-way and n-way, two options or multiple options for execution paths.
C89, C99, Python and C++
A C++ test variable cannot be a string, while a C# test variable can be.
A counter-controlled loop runs on the basis of a counter, starting and ending at specified points. A logically controlled loop runs until a logical condition is either met or no longer met.
Break exits the immediate loop being run in, continue jumps to the next iteration of the immediate loop being run in.
Unconditional branching makes error tracing, maintenance and vulnerability patching harder.
Guarded is a boolean proposition / precondition on statements for error avoidance and control over 'goto' portions of code. Assures an outcome.
if a < b -> min := a; 

[] a >= b -> min := b; 

fi;

-or-

if(a<b){

min=a; 

}

else{

min =b;

}

This assures max is always set to the minimum value between a and b.
