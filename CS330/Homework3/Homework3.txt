Define syntax and semantics. 

Syntax is the form or structure of expressions, statements and program units. Semantics is the meaning of those expressions, statements and units (what their effect is).

What is the difference between a sentence and a sentential form?

A sentential form is a string of symbols in a derivation, while a sentence only has terminal symbols.

When is a grammar said to be 'ambiguous'?

Grammar becomes ambiguous when it creates a sentential form that has two or more distinct parse trees.

What three extensions are common to most EBNFs?

EBNF added := over =>, using opt and oneof.

Distinguish between static and dynamic semantics.

Static semantics are only relevant prior to compiling, like types, while dynamic semantics have meaning (relevance) after compilation and in execution in expressions, statements, and prog. units.

What is the primary use of attribute grammars.

The primary use of attribute grammars is testing for compatibility.

Describe the two levels of usage of operational semantics. 

How things affect the state of the machine. (simulated and actual?) VM.

What is stored in the state of the program for denotational semantics?

The values of all variables is stored for denotational semantics.

On what branch of mathematics are denotational and axiomatic semantics based on?

Denotational and axiomatic semantics are based on mathematical logic.

Explain 'weakest precondition' with an example. 

Weakest precondition refers to finding the least possible value which satisfies the statement lists.

Ex: {P} y= x - 1, z = y * 3, {z > 0}

wp(y = x - 1; z = y * 3, Q)

= wp(y = x - 1, wp(z = y * 3, z > 0))

= wp(y = x - 1, y > 0)

= x > 1
